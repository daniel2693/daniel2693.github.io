<h3>My interest and history in IT</h3>
<p>I've been interested in IT since a very young age. It started with video games on my aunties PC (windows 95!) they seemed like magic to me and eventually I wanted to to know how they worked, so unfortunatly her computer bore the grunt of my experements. Eg, what happenes if I delete this? or what happens if I unplug that?  eventually it got to the point where it stopped working haha. since then I've always loved tinkering with computers and have built several for myself and my friends and family. I'd love to one day get a job in cybersecurity or become a network engineer</p>

<h3>Why have I chosen to study at RMIT?</h3>
<p>I chose to study online at RMIT because I work full time and need the flexability of being able to watch the lectures in my own time.</p>

<h3>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h3>
<p> Ideally I'd like to learn the fundementals so that I can progress further into uni and complete either a Degree in Cybersecurity or network engineering.</p>
